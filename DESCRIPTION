Description: A collection of tools for multivariate analysis of metabolomics
    data, which includes several preprocessing methods (normalization, scaling)
    and various exploration and data visualization techniques (Principal
    Components Analysis and Multi Dimensional Scaling). The core of the package
    is the Random Forest algorithm used for the construction, optimization and
    validation of classification models with the aim of identifying potentially
    relevant biomarkers.
